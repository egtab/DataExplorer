# DataExplorer

## List of Classes
**1. DBConnect**
* This class connects to the database server and executes the SQL queries.

**2. MyGUI**
* This class implements the GUI for the program using Java Swing. 
* It also uses methods from the DBConnect class.

**3. Control**
* This class creates a MyGUI object and contains the main method the
program is executed from.

## Core Functionality
* Program successfully connects to SQL Server database using JDBC.
* Queries can be made to the selected database and is displayed.
* Query paramters can be put in through GUI.

## Optional Functionality
* Query results can be seen through the GUI - results can be displayed on a GUI JTable.
* Flexible queries - can filter through results based on the different groups in the 
data set like gender and age.
* Query results can also be viewed and compared through a bar chart, made using JFreeChart.

## What I Would Add If I Had More Time
* More flexible queries - I would add more filter options, like filtering by the most popular
factor, or the least popular factor.
* Improved GUI - I would like to create a more attractive design, and try different layouts
to find what would be the most suitable.
